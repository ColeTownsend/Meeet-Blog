Noah and I just started back up with school so development has slowed a bit while we get in the groove. However, this week we knocked out some bugs with tweet and fixed some issues with chat. 

<blockquote>
<h3><span class="update">Update</span>Removing Direct Messages</h3>
We've come to realize we moved too soon on our chat feature. We're going to create a seperate avenue of communication that will go through Twitter. We realize this is imperfect, but in order to focus on our project creation and application process, it is a must.

<h3><span class="update">Update</span>New Developer</h3>
We're working on getting another developer and are currently speaking to the amazing <a href="https://jesse.sh/">Jesse Shawl</a>. You may have used his blog to help set up Node on your laptop or streamline your Jekyll workflow.

<h3><span class="update">Update</span>Podcast in the Works</h3>
We're going to get a line up of interviews for our podcast on side projects. If you think you have an awesome story to share, <a href="mailto:us@meeet.co">email us</a>!

</blockquote>

## A few goals for the week ahead:

- Streamline the application system
- Get a new developer on board!
- Create a new communication avenue (probably twitter)
