Noah and I just started back up with school so development has slowed a bit while we get in the groove. However, this week we knocked out some bugs with tweet and fixed some issues with chat. 

<blockquote>
<h3><span class="stats">Stats</span>5 days to Go</h3>
We've raised $1,556. We still need more donations â€” spread the word! <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Meeet%20by%20Meeet%20Co&via=kickstarter&url=http://kck.st/1kYExFk">Tell all of your friends</a>!

<h3><span class="update">Update</span>New Developer</h3>
We're working on getting another developer and are currently speaking to Jesse Shawl.

<h3><span class="update">Update</span>Podcast in the Works</h3>
We're going to get a line up of interviews for our podcast on side projects. If you think you have an awesome story to share, <a href="mailto:us@meeet.co">email us</a>!

</blockquote>

## A few goals for the week ahead:

- Move back to the invite system
- Simplify the application system
- Surpass Kickstarter goal
- Finalize Tee Shirt Designs
- Get a new developer on board!
