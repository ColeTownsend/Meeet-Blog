We realize we were a bit ambitious in our current design. That's why we're going to strip down some of the features from the beta until they are ready for release.

That means we're getting rid of direct messaging *for now*.

What we're going to do is instead have everyone's Twitter username attached to their profile. We're going to allow you guys to communicate outside of Meeet on your own initiative, because *we cannot yet provide you the best experience*. Our messaging system is frustrating and imperfect. It's something we really need to re-examine and re-test.

## Applications
We are also aiming to alter the application process.

Our initial idea was to require a statement from the applicant regarding their interest. This provides both an opportunity for the applicant to cancel their application and to show the depth of their interest. We're going to build that in during the next two weeks of transition while we get our new developer up to speed.

## Incoming
We're going to pair down what Meeet is offering when we switch from beta to production. We're stripping out everything that doesn't work just right yet, and keeping that stuff just for the beta â€” because that's what beta is for.
