Hey guys! Thank you for continuing to bring in the dollar bills. We're doing excellent right now in our Kickstarter, and _we are going to meet our goal_. I think that Meeet would be able to offer much more however if we exceeded our goal. We want to help people ship side projects. 

> Pledging on Kickstarter will ensure that everyone with an idea and a little know-how can work together to build something awesome.

<h3><span class="milestone">Milestone</span>Total Pledges in Dollars: 1,445</h3>
We're nearly halfway with just well over two weeks to go in our campaign.
<h3><span class="milestone">Milestone</span>More Collaborations</h3>
We spoke with the fine guys over at Pop.co and we're going to be working closely with them. They have some very exciting news about their service and we know they can be a huge help with shipping your side projects.
<h3><span class="update">Update</span>DMs in Progress</h3>
We're still working out direct messaging. Both Noah and I have been a bit busy with the fall-back-to-school craze but we're going to keep grinding.
<h3><span class="update">Update</span>Temporarily Removed "People"</h3>
We're having an issue listing users, so we've temporarily removed that link. We're going to reimplement it over the next week. It's come to light that it's a slighter bigger problem than Noah expected. Not to fear! He's on top of it.

## A few goals for the week ahead:

- Re-implement "People" List
- Finish Tee shirt designs for Kickstarter
- Secure 2 (more) discounts (again)
- Knock out some work on DMs
