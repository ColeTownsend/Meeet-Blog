Meeet started off as a simple direct message on Twitter to a fellow designer. No plan, no elaborate office on the west coast, and no fancy investors. Yet.

<hr>

I’d seen Cole’s work featured on many design websites months before reaching out to him. I was really getting into the open source community around then and had a few projects on my GitHub profile with tens of thousands of views. Followers on Twitter started to pick up a bit, and after checking my notifications one day, to my surprise, Cole followed me!

It was neat at first, but I didn’t think anything of it, until a few months later when I knew I wanted to start work on a project that would be my main focus for a few months instead of doing two-day projects that only had a few users.

I reached out to him via a direct message on Twitter to see if he’d be up to working on a project some time in the future. To my surprise, he said yes! There was just one problem: I didn’t have an idea. Well… Turned out that that was the exact idea I needed! When Cole asked to brainstorm a few ideas, I responded with a web service that would help developers and designers find projects to work on, and after a few more messages exchanged, he was in!

Over the course of the next few weeks, Cole and I put together a little landing page that would be sufficient until we had time, after developing the main website, to create a new landing page. In the course of those three months in development, we had no more than 400 users sign up for the waiting list.

> I feel the community that Meeet is made for doesn't judge you by your age. You’re judged by the quality of work you produce. And Meeet is pretty damn good.

We were ready to go! We took a week to design the database structure, basic site layout, and features to include in the first version of Meeet. I decided to go with Node.js, Mongodb, Jade, and plain old CSS as the stack. Luckily, Cole noted that the project would be next to impossible to maintain with simple CSS files, so we went with Sass, and I couldn't be more glad he pushed for that. I was stubborn. Trust me.

Over the next three months I tried to find odd hours between sports and school to work on developing Meeet. Somehow it seemed to all work out, though progress could have been sped up if I wasn’t so bad at putting tasks off and timezones were eliminated, and if you ever worked remotely, I think you’ll understand.

Every **every** creative and developer I’ve had the pleasure of talking to has always had so many amazing ideas for projects they’d like to start, but lack the needed skills. Creating side projects has so many benefits, ranging from meeting new people and learning new skills to building your portfolio and generating reavnue.

The past two weeks have been a blur for me. As this is my first startup, the response has seemed pretty good! We’ve been ranked at the top of Designer News, Betalist, Product Hunt, and Hacker News. Meeet has also had a few articles written about it, including a quick appearance on Fox Business as one of the most upvoted Product Hunt posts and a feature in Web Designer Depot’s July ‘14 roundup.

<del>We’re going to launch public beta next week, and we hope to see you there!</del> Join <del>the waiting list (now over 5,000 amazing people!)</del> our beta, and you’ll be the first to know. We also have a [press kit](https://github.com/NoahBuscher/Meeet-Press-Kit) if you’re interested in what goes on behind the scenes.
