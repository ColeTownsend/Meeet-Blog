We're into our second full week. It's been an awesome ride so far and the updates are continuing to roll in! We're super stoked about the new stuff and the pesky bug fixes.

<blockquote>
<h3><span class="update">Update</span>Project Status</h3>
We've applied some new project states, so now it's more obvious if a project is in progress or finished. 

<h3><span class="update">Update</span>Direct Messaging</h3>
We have a rudimentary messaging system. It's far from perfect and we're building it out in the next couple days.
</blockquote>

<h2>On the Horizon</h2>

- Stats for your project
- Overall stats for Meeet (live updates too!)
- Fully implementing Direct Messaging
- Minor UX changes for project and profile creation
- Links in the Activity dropdown
- Fixing autolinking in project descriptions
