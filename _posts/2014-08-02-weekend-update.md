We have a lot of awesome stuff brewing up for all of you. _Thank you for being incredibly patient and bearing with our server issues._ We've upgraded everything, and should experience limited downtime and soon â€” no downtime.

<h3>Fresh Blog</h3>
We have a new blog where we will post updates, keep track of feature requests (eventually), and post the top cuts from Meeet.

<h3>Autolinking in Project Descriptions</h3>
Now if you have some sort of working URL in the description, it'll be blue and clickable. Neato!

<h2>On the Horizon</h2>

We're working on implementing:

- __Ask to Apply__
- Firing project partners
- Confirmation modals for hiring and firing
- Direct messages
- New tags
- Links in activity dropdown

<h3>More on Direct Messages</h3>
We've heard your cries for a better messaging system. We're working on building a direct messaging interface so you can speak with candidates before you accept their application. These will be project specific to help you keep track of who's talking about what.

<h3>More on New Tags</h3>
We're adding more programming languages and different types of design to our tag database. Please keep emailing us and requesting them.
