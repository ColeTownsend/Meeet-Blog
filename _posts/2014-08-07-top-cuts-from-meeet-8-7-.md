title: Top Cuts from Meeet 8/7
categories: cuts
---

Quite a bit has happened over here at Meeet HQ in the past week. Even though I was traveling, we still managed to roll out simple direct messages, daily rankings, real-time search, one-button Twitter sharing, and, my personal favorite, lazy loading. Cole and I would also like to welcome [Benjamin](https://twitter.com/nhqe) to the team. He’s extremely talented and is going to help Meeet become as kick-ass as possible.

Of course, we still have a ton to do, and our main focus this week will be helping you find projects that fit your skills. We already have a few ideas in mind, but we’re always open for more.

__Here are Team Meeet's top picks for the week of 8/7:__

### [Closet](http://beta.meeet.co/abinav/Closet)
Upload the contents in your closet and let others create outfits for you.

### [Hatch](http://beta.meeet.co/iruchan/Hatch)

### [MusicHub](http://beta.meeet.co/asim/MusicHub)
Share and collaborate on songs.

### [Staff Fit](http://beta.meeet.co/chrispas/Staff%20fit)
