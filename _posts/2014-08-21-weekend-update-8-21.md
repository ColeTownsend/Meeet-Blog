So this is crazy. [We've launched a Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/meeet/meeet-co-finish-your-side-projects-find-your-next). Your support was overwhelming for Meeet. So much so that our servers, email lists, and Slack feed are overrun. We want to take Meeet to the next level — bigger and better servers, Pro accounts, tee shirts, user avatars, and a job list.

Whoa. That's a lot of people acting on their ideas.
<h3><span class="stats">Stats</span>Total users: 3400</h3>
Tell your friends! It's clearly working. Thank you all for your support. You keep Noah and I excited.
<h3><span class="stats">Stats</span>Total active projects: 93</h3>
You guys are killing it. We can't wait to put up the "Featured Projects" page!

<h3><span class="update">Update</span>Email Subscriptions</h3>
You can now change what kinds of emails you get. You can subscribe or unsubscribe from both bi-weekly updates as well as direct message notifications.
<h3><span class="update">Update</span>Linked Activity Feeds</h3>
We now have some delicious links in our activity feeds so you can skip clicking on "see more" and jump right into the action.
<h3><span class="update">Update</span>Kickstarter!</h3>
We're sitting at about $700 right now. That's just short of 20% and it's only been about 36 hours. Also, our stickers look sweet. [http://fund.meeet.co](Get stickers.)

We're really excited about expanding our product. We're planning on building in third party integrations and getting sweet deals on other services to help you up the ante on your projects — Layervault, Product Hunt, Github, Heroku, and a bunch more. _We're also looking to build out the Meeet API to get integration with Slack channels so you can track who has applied, comments, and direct messages._ [Invest and change the future.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/meeet/meeet-co-finish-your-side-projects-find-your-next)

Just think, you'll have the opportunity to get your hands on one of these guys.
