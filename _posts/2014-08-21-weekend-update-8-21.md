So this is crazy. [We've launched a Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/meeet/meeet-co-finish-your-side-projects-find-your-next). Your support was overwhelming for Meeet. So much so that our servers, email lists, and Slack feed are overrun. We want to take Meeet to the next level — bigger and better servers, Pro accounts, tee shirts, user avatars, and a job list. 

> Total projects: 244
