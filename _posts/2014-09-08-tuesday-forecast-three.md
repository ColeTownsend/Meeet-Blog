Noah and I just started back up with school so development has slowed a bit while we get in the groove. However, this week we knocked out some bugs with tweet and fixed some issues with chat. 

<blockquote>
<h3><span class="stats">Stats</span> Over $1,400 Raised</h3>
We've raised $1,440. That's more than a third of our goal, and we've been fundraising for less than a week! You guys are awesome. <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Meeet%20by%20Meeet%20Co&via=kickstarter&url=http://kck.st/1kYExFk">Tell all of your friends</a>!

<h3><span class="update">Update</span>Further Implementing Messaging</h3>
Now messages are automatically scrolled to the latest message, and they have your lovely faces next to them.

## A few goals for the week ahead:

- Build in chat specific notification
- Re-implement "People"
- Secure 1 more discount for the Teem
- Reach 60% of our Kickstarter goal
- Speak with Tee shirt producers
