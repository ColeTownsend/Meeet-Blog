Wow. It’s only been two days since Meeet’s public beta launch. We’ve been busying ourselves over here at Meeet HQ with answering tickets, squashing bugs, pushing features, and talking with you guys.

So far, over 2500 users have signed up, more than 100 projects have been posted, and we’ve answered almost 600 emails (not counting dozens of amazing conversations with users in the chat).

We have tons of great new features we’re going to roll out soon, including direct messages, better discussions, sexier emails, improved ranking algorithms, a follow button, our own blog, and tons more! We’re super excited and hope you’ll stick with us in the coming weeks.
