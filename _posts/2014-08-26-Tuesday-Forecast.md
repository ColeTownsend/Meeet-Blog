Thank you all for your support. It's been phenomenal so far â€” we love seeing you share your projects and our Kickstarter on Twitter. Thanks to you we've raised more than a third of our [Kickstarter](http://fund.meeet.co) goal of the the last few days. 

We're currently speaking withcompanies to acquire some coupons, discounts, and special deals for the Teeem.

<h3><span class="stats">Stats</span>Over $1000 Raised</h3>
We've raised $1,163. That's more than a third of our goal, and we've been fundraising for less than a week! You guys are awesome. [Tell all of your friends](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Meeet%20by%20Meeet%20Co&via=kickstarter&url=http://kck.st/1kYExFk)!

<h3><span class="update">Update</span>Layervault Deals</h3>
Thanks to the Kelly Sutton and Layervault Team, we can offer the first few finished projects some awesome deals as they continue to develop.

<h3><span class="update">Update</span>Stickers!</h3>
I've finished the sticker designs that will be with the $10 pledge and maybe a few lucky $5 pledges. [Check them out](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/meeet/meeet-co-finish-your-side-projects-find-your-next/posts/960745).

A few goals for the week ahead:

1. Fully implement direct messages
2. Re-implement "People"
3. Secure 2 new discounts for the Teem
4. Reach 60% of our Kickstarter goal
