<p>So this is crazy. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/meeet/meeet-co-finish-your-side-projects-find-your-next">We&rsquo;ve launched a Kickstarter</a>. Your support was overwhelming for Meeet. So much so that our servers, email lists, and Slack feed are overrun. We want to take Meeet to the next level — bigger and better servers, Pro accounts, tee shirts, user avatars, and a job list.</p>

<blockquote><p>Total projects: 244</p>

<p>Total users: 3400</p>

<p>Total active projects: 93</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/meeet/meeet-co-finish-your-side-projects-find-your-next">Invest and change the future.</a></p>
